<h2>Lemon tree</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pra4aAIsg_I">I'm sittin' here in the boring room</a>

It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon

I'm wasting my time

I got nothin' to do

I'm hangin' around

I'm waitin' for you

But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm drivin' around in my car

I'm drivin' too fast

I'm drivin' too far

I'd like to change my point of view

I feel so lonely

I'm waitin' for you

But nothing ever happens and I wonder
<p>

I wonder how

I wonder why

Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky

And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree

I'm turnin' my head up and down

I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around

And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

Sing!</P>

I'm sittin' here

I miss the power

I'd like to go out takin' a shower

But there's a heavy cloud inside my head

I feel so tired

Put myself into bed

Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder

Isolation is not good for me

Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree

I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy

Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy

And everything will happen and you wonder

I wonder how

I wonder why

Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky

And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

I'm turnin' my head up and down

I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around

And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree

And I wonder, wonder

I wonder how

I wonder why

Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky

And all that I can see

And all that I can see

And all that I can see

Is just a yellow lemon tree
